BloodConnect is a NGO that aims eradicating blood shortage problem from our society. We started with
the motive to help this organization with their database query management, and provide them with better donor
search results so that their hit ratio increases. We worked with their database to device some algorithm which
suits them the most. Dynamic querying on the probabilistic database using nearest neighbor algorithms on Rtree
data structure is how we sailed across the problem.
